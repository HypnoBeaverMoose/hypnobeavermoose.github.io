## Implementation


### Lingua Franca.NET

The question now is, what language to you use to implement a language? Well, you can use any actually. And depending on your choice you can have a very different experience. Bob uses Java in the first part of his book, but I went with C# because I know and like it much better than Java. Choosing a high level language for your first implementation is very convenient, because you get a bunch of goodies like garbage collection for free and you can represent a lot of abstractions through abstractions in the original language.
